### neovimconfig

This is my personal neovim config setup

The initial form of the config is heavily inspired by @ThePrimeagen

If you would like to use this, simply copy files to .config/vim folder

I use vim-plug as my plug-in manager, so to install plugins:
- Enter neovim
- Type command ":PlugInstall"
